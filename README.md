# Movies List App

Basic app to search for movies. You can create your lists or add movies to your favorites. Click on the movies to see details and click on the actors to see their cinematography and biography. It is responsive and works on mobile too. 

The lists and favorites work on localStorage so be sure to use it on the same device.

Initially I put some steps to run it locally but I figured out how to get it on Github Pages!
